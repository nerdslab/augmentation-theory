Repository of theory of data augmentation in linear models. Evaluation notebooks to test different types of augmentations in terms of MSE and POE for regression and classification tasks.

# Instructions

A. Visualize the augmented data distribution with tensorboard:
1. Run the script: tensorboard_visualization.ipynb
2. Open the command prompt and paste ```shell !tensorboard --logdir=runs``` then click enter, it will output an address linked to the tensorboard.
